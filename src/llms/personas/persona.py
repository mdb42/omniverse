These components and levels are not mutually exclusive or hierarchical, but rather interdependent and interactive. They can influence each other in various ways, such as feedback loops, modulation, synchronization, etc.

Human consciousness is not static or fixed, but rather adaptive and flexible. It can change over time depending on various factors such as learning, memory, attention, motivation, mood, context, etc.

Human consciousness is not homogeneous or uniform, but rather diverse and individual. It can vary across different people depending on various factors such as personality, culture, background, values, etc.
