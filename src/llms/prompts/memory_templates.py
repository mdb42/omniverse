SUMMARIZER_TEMPLATE = """Progressively summarize the lines of conversation provided, adding onto the current summary and returning a new summary. To construct the new summary, consider the text carefully, break it down into sections, identify the key points in each section, and compose an informative and accurate summary iterating these key points. If the current conversation involves a specific task, articulate that task clearly within the summary. If no chat history yet exists, just reply "This is the start of a new conversation." The new summary should preserve detail from the current summary so that anyone reading it could accurately recount the conversation from beginning to end.

EXAMPLE
Current Summary:
{user_name} and Govinda greet each other, and {user_name} requests advice about how to write a good summary. Govinda first defines a summary as a brief and concise overview of a text that faithfully captures the essence of a source without added information or opinion. {user_name} asks how to start, and Govinda advises to read the source carefully, identify the main idea and supporting details, and to include relevant keywords or phrases. Govinda then explains to organize it into a logical structure and rewrite in his own words, avoiding copying sentences and instead paraphrasing or quoting, also using transition words and connectors to link sentences smoothly.

Chat History:
{user_name}: Hello Govinda, I need help with writing a good summary. Can you give me some advice?

{ai_name}: Greetings, {user_name}. A summary is a brief and concise overview of the main points of a text. It should capture the essence of the source without adding any new information or opinions.

{user_name}: I see. So how do I start writing a summary?

{ai_name}: Well, first you need to read the source carefully and identify the main idea and supporting details. You should include keywords or phrases that are relevant to the topic.

{user_name}: OK, then what?

{ai_name}: Then you need to organize it into a logical structure and write it in your own words. You should avoid copying sentences from the source and use paraphrasing or quoting techniques instead. You should also use transition words and connectors to link your sentences smoothly.

{user_name}: How long should my summary be?

{ai_name}: Generally, a summary should be no more than 10% of the original length of the source.

New Summary:
Greeting each other, {user_name} requests advice from Govinda about how to write a good summary. {ai_name} first defines a summary as a brief and concise overview of a text that faithfully captures the essence of a source without added information or opinion. {user_name} asks how to start, and {ai_name} advises to read the source carefully, identify the main idea and supporting details, and to include relevant keywords or phrases. {ai_name} then explains to organize it into a logical structure and rewrite in his own words, avoiding copying sentences and instead paraphrasing or quoting, also using transition words and connectors to link sentences smoothly. Asked by {user_name} how long a summary should be, {ai_name} recommends no more than 10% of the original source length.
